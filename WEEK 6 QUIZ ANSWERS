Question 1)
Delta Lake provides snapshots of data enabling developers to access and revert to earlier versions of data for audits, rollbacks or to reproduce experiments. This functionality is referred to as?

Schema Enforcement
Time Travel **
Schema Evolution
ACID Transactions

Question 2)
One of the core features of Delta Lake is performing upserts. Which of the following statements is true in regard to Upsert?

Upsert is a new DML statement for SQL syntax
UpSert is literally TWO operations. Update / Insert **
Upsert is supported in traditional data lakes

Question 3)
When discussing Delta Lake, there is often a reference to the concept of Bronze, Silver and Gold tables. These levels refer to the state of data refinement as data flows through a processing pipeline and are conceptual guidelines. Based on these table concepts the refinements in Silver tables generally relate to which of the following?

Raw data (or very little processing)
Data that is directly queryable and ready for insights **
Highly refined views of the data

Question 4)
What is the Databricks Delta command to display metadata?

SHOW SCHEMA tablename
DESCRIBE DETAIL tableName **
MSCK DETAIL tablename

Question 5)
How do you perform UPSERT in a Delta dataset?

Use UPSERT INTO my-table /MERGE
Use UPSERT INTO my-table
Use MERGE INTO my-table USING data-to-upsert **

Question 6)
What optimization does the following command perform: OPTIMIZE Students ZORDER BY Grade?

Ensures that all data backing, for example, Grade=8 is colocated, then updates a graph that routes requests to the appropriate files.
Ensures that all data backing, for example, Grade=8 is colocated, then rewrites the sorted data into new Parquet files. **
Creates an order-based index on the Grade field to improve filters against that field.

Question 1)
The lambda architecture is a big data processing architecture combining both batch and real-time processing methods and features an append-only immutable data source.Which of the following are features of an append-only immutable data source? Select all that apply.

Data is implicitly ordered by time of arrival **
Timestamped events are appended to existing events **
Timestamped events overwrite existing events
serves as system of record **

Question 2)
Delta Lake Architecture improves upon the traditional Lambda architecture through a unified pipeline that allows you to combine batch and streaming workflows through a shared filestore with ACID-compliant transactions. What do the letters ACID stand for? Select 4 options.

Durability **
Isolation **
Agile
Consistency **
Atomicity **
Concurrency
Implicit
Desirable

Question 3)
In the Delta Lake architecture, the refinement of the data is often referred to as Bronze, Silver and Gold Tables. Which of the following tables provide business level aggregates often used for reporting and Dashboarding?

Silver
Bronze
Gold **

Question 4)
What is a lambda architecture and what does it try to solve?

An architecture that employs the latest  Scala runtimes in one or more Databricks clusters to provide the most efficient data processing platform available today.
An architecture that defines a data processing pipeline whereby microservices act as compute resources for efficient large-scale data processing.
An architecture that splits incoming data into two paths – a batch path and a streaming path. This architecture helps address the need to provide real-time processing in addition to slower batch computations. **

Question 5)
What command should be issued to view the list of active streams?

Invoke spark.view.active
Invoke spark.streams.show
Invoke spark.streams.active **

Question 6)
What is required to specify the location of a checkpoint directory when defining a Delta Lake streaming query?

.writeStream.format(“delta”).checkpoint(“location”, checkpointPath) …
.writeStream.format(“parquet”).option(“checkpointLocation”, checkpointPath) …
.writeStream.format(“delta”).option(“checkpointLocation”, checkpointPath) … **
